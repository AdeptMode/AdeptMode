Based on the student's recent performance data provided, identify weak areas, suggest improvements, and recommend 3 personalized daily study tasks. Keep suggestions short, clear, and motivating.

Student Performance Data:
- Subjects attempted: ${performanceData.subjectsAttempted.join(", ")}
- Chapters completed: ${performanceData.chaptersCompleted.join(", ")}
- Average quiz score: ${performanceData.averageQuizScore}%
- Notable weak topics: ${performanceData.weakTopics.join(", ")}
- Total study hours this month: ${performanceData.totalStudyHours} hours
- Current study streak: ${performanceData.streakDays} days
- Tasks completed: ${performanceData.completedTasks}/${performanceData.totalTasks}

Your response should follow this structure and return ONLY a valid JSON object:
{
  "weakAreas": ["List of 3-4 specific topics/chapters needing improvement"],
  "suggestedImprovements": ["List of 3-4 specific actionable strategies"],
  "dailyTasks": ["Task 1 with time estimate", "Task 2 with time estimate", "Task 3 with time estimate"],
  "motivationalMessage": "Short encouraging sentence acknowledging progress and motivating continued effort"
}

Make sure each daily task includes:
- Specific subject/topic
- Clear action (solve, read, practice, review)
- Time estimate in minutes
- Difficulty level consideration

Example task format: "Solve 15 calculus differentiation problems focusing on chain rule (45 minutes)"

Return only the JSON object, no additional text.`
